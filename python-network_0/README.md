### How to make a request with cURL
To make a request with cURL, you need to use the curl command followed by options and the URL you want to send the request to. Here's the basic syntax:
                        curl [options] [URL]
#### HTTP Method (-X or --request):
- By default, cURL sends a GET request. If you want to use a different HTTP method, you can specify it using the -X or --request option followed by the desired method. For example, -X POST or --request PUT.
#### Headers (-H or --header):
- You can include custom headers in your request using the -H or --header option. Headers are specified as "Header-Name: Header-Value". For example, -H "Content-Type: application/json".
#### Request Body (-d or --data):
- If you need to send data in the request body, you can use the -d or --data option followed by the data you want to send. For example, 
-d '{"name":"John", "age":30}'. This is often used with POST or PUT requests.
#### Include Response Headers (-i or --include):
- If you want to include the response headers in the output, you can use the -i or --include option. This is useful for inspecting the headers returned by the server along with the response body.
#### Save Response to a File (-o or --output):
- If you want to save the response content to a file instead of displaying it in the console, you can use the -o or --output option followed by the file path. For example, -o response.txt.
#### Verbose Output (-v or --verbose):
- The -v or --verbose option displays detailed information about the request and response, including the headers and other details. This can be helpful for debugging purposes.
#### examples
- GET request
curl https://api.example.com/users
- Making a POST request with JSON data:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"John", "age":30}' https://api.example.com/users

In these examples, replace https://api.example.com/users with the actual URL you want to send the request to. You can customize the options based on your specific requirements.

### What a URL is
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a specific web address that is used to locate a resource on the internet. It is a string of characters that serves as the unique identifier for a resource, such as a webpage, an image, a document, or any other file that can be accessed via the internet.
### A typical URL consists of several components:
- Protocol: This specifies the communication protocol to be used when accessing the resource. The most common protocol is "http://" or "https://" for web pages, but there are also others like "ftp://" for file transfers or "mailto://" for email addresses.
- Domain Name: This is the unique name that identifies a website on the internet. For example, "example.com" or "google.com". The domain name is typically followed by a top-level domain (TLD) such as ".com", ".org", ".net", or country-specific TLDs like ".uk" or ".fr".
- Path: The path refers to the specific location of a resource on a server. It is a hierarchical structure that represents directories and subdirectories on the server. For example, "/products/electronics/" could be a path to a webpage about electronics products.
- Query Parameters: Query parameters are optional components that can be added to a URL to provide additional information or instructions to the server. They are appended to the end of the URL and usually start with a "?" followed by key-value pairs separated by "&". For example, "?category=books&sort=price" could be query parameters specifying the category and sorting criteria for a product search.
+ Here is an example of a URL: "https://www.example.com/products/electronics/?category=phones&sort=price". In this example, the URL specifies the use of the HTTPS protocol, the domain name is "www.example.com", the path is "/products/electronics/", and the query parameters are "category=phones&sort=price".
+ When you enter a URL into a web browser, it sends a request to the server specified in the URL, asking for the corresponding resource. The server then responds with the requested resource, which can be displayed in the browser or processed by other applications.
## What HTTP is
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application protocol used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web and is responsible for the transfer of hypertext, which includes text, images, videos, and other resources.

HTTP follows a client-server model, where the client, typically a web browser, sends requests to the server, and the server responds with the requested data. This communication is carried out through a series of messages between the client and the server.
### Key features of HTTP include:
- Statelessness: HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that each request made by the client is independent and unrelated to any previous requests. The server does not maintain any information about the client's previous requests or state. This statelessness simplifies server design and allows for easy scalability.
- Request methods: HTTP defines various request methods, also known as verbs, that specify the action the client wants the server to perform. The most common methods are GET (retrieve a resource), POST (submit data to be processed), PUT (update a resource), and DELETE (remove a resource). These methods allow clients to interact with web servers in different ways.
- Status codes: HTTP uses status codes to indicate the outcome of a request. These codes are three-digit numbers sent by the server in response to a client's request. Examples include 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error). Status codes provide information about whether a request was successful, encountered an error, or requires further action.
- Headers: HTTP headers are additional pieces of information sent along with a request or response. They provide metadata about the request or response, such as the content type, caching instructions, authentication credentials, and more. Headers allow clients and servers to exchange information and control how requests and responses are processed.
- Versioning: HTTP has evolved over time, with different versions being released. The most commonly used versions are HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. Each version introduces new features, improvements in performance, and better handling of various aspects of web communication.

HTTP is the foundation of web browsing and enables users to access and interact with websites, retrieve resources, submit forms, and perform various operations on the web. It provides a standardized way for clients and servers to communicate and exchange information, making the web a globally accessible and interconnected network of resources.
### How to read a URL
To read a URL, you can break it down into its constituent parts and interpret each component. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to read a URL:
- Identify the Protocol: The URL typically starts with a protocol identifier, such as "http://" or "https://". This indicates the communication protocol to be used when accessing the resource. "http://" is the standard protocol for web browsing, while "https://" is a secure version that encrypts the data transmission.
- Determine the Domain Name: The domain name is the unique identifier for a website. It usually follows the protocol and is preceded by "www.". For example, in the URL "https://www.example.com", the domain name is "example.com". The domain name identifies the specific website or server where the resource is hosted.
- Locate the Path: The path represents the specific location of the resource on the server. It starts after the domain name and is separated by forward slashes ("/"). The path may include directories and subdirectories, indicating the file structure on the server. For instance, in the URL "https://www.example.com/products/electronics/", the path is "/products/electronics/".
- Identify Query Parameters (if applicable): Query parameters are optional components appended to the end of a URL after a question mark ("?"). They provide additional information or instructions to the server. Query parameters are usually in the form of key-value pairs, separated by ampersands ("&"). For example, in the URL "https://www.example.com/search?query=books&page=2", the query parameters are "query=books" and "page=2".

By understanding these components, you can comprehend the purpose and structure of a URL. It's worth noting that URLs can sometimes contain additional elements, such as fragments (indicated by a hash symbol "#") for scrolling to a specific section within a webpage. Additionally, URL encoding is used to represent special characters or spaces in a URL using percent encoding ("%20" represents a space, for example).
Reading a URL allows you to grasp the target website, the specific resource being accessed, and any additional instructions or parameters associated with the request.
### The scheme for a HTTP URL
The scheme is the first part of a URL and indicates the communication protocol to be used when accessing the resource. In the case of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), the scheme is "http://". This scheme is commonly used for web browsing and data transfer over the internet.

When you see a URL that starts with "http://", it signifies that the resource is accessed using the HTTP protocol. HTTP is a request-response protocol, where a client (such as a web browser) sends a request to a server, and the server responds with the requested data.

It's worth mentioning that there is also a secure version of HTTP called HTTPS (HTTP Secure). The scheme for HTTPS URLs is "https://". HTTPS uses encryption to secure the communication between the client and the server, providing enhanced security for data transmission.

Overall, the scheme "http://" in a URL indicates the use of the HTTP protocol for accessing the resource.
### What a domain name is
A domain name is a unique and human-readable identifier that is used to locate and access websites on the internet. It is part of a larger system called the Domain Name System (DNS), which translates domain names into the numerical IP addresses that computers use to communicate with each other.
A domain name consists of two main parts: the actual domain name and the top-level domain (TLD). For example, in the domain name "example.com", "example" is the actual domain name, and ".com" is the TLD. The TLD represents the category or type of organization associated with the domain, such as ".com" for commercial websites, ".org" for non-profit organizations, or ".edu" for educational institutions

Here are some key points about domain names:
- Human-Readable: Domain names are designed to be easy for humans to remember and use in accessing websites. They provide a more user-friendly alternative to IP addresses, which are strings of numbers that computers use to identify each other.
- Unique Identification: Each domain name is unique, meaning that no two websites can have the exact same domain name. This uniqueness allows users to access specific websites by typing in the corresponding domain name.
- Hierarchy: Domain names follow a hierarchical structure, with the TLD at the highest level. Below the TLD, there can be additional levels called subdomains, which can further categorize or organize websites. For example, "blog.example.com" is a subdomain of the "example.com" domain.
- Registration: Domain names need to be registered through accredited domain registrars. These registrars are responsible for managing and maintaining the registration of domain names, ensuring that each name is associated with the correct IP address and owner.
- Internet Addressing: Domain names are an essential part of the internet's addressing system. When a user enters a domain name in a web browser, the DNS translates that name into the corresponding IP address of the server hosting the website, allowing the browser to establish a connection and retrieve the requested content.
Overall, a domain name serves as a memorable and recognizable identifier for websites, enabling users to access specific online resources easily. It plays a crucial role in how websites are located and reached on the internet.
### What a sub-domain is
A subdomain is a part of a larger domain name. It allows for further organization and subdivision of a domain into smaller sections, each with its own unique address and content. Subdomains are created by adding a prefix to the main domain name, separated by a dot (period).
For example, in the domain name "blog.example.com", "blog" is a subdomain of "example.com". Here, "example.com" is the main domain, and "blog.example.com" represents a subdomain specifically dedicated to hosting a blog.
By utilizing subdomains, website owners can organize their content, provide a logical structure, and create a more personalized browsing experience for users. Subdomains offer flexibility and allow for different sections of a website to be managed independently while still being part of the overall domain.
### How to define a port number in a URL
To define a port number in a URL, you can include it after the domain name or IP address, separated by a colon (":"). The port number identifies a specific communication endpoint within a server where the requested resource can be accessed.
Here is the general syntax for including a port number in a URL:
                                protocol://domain:port/path
For example, if you want to specify port number 8080 for accessing a resource on the domain "example.com" using the HTTP protocol, the URL would be:
                                http://example.com:8080/path/to/resource
In this example, "http://" indicates the HTTP protocol, "example.com" is the domain name, and ":8080" specifies the port number.

It's important to note that many protocols have default port numbers associated with them. For instance, HTTP typically uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443, FTP (File Transfer Protocol) uses port 21, and so on. If the requested resource is hosted on the default port for the protocol, there is no need to explicitly specify the port number in the URL. However, if the resource is hosted on a different port, you need to specify it in the URL to ensure the request reaches the correct endpoint.

Including the port number in the URL allows the web browser or other HTTP client to establish a connection to the correct port on the server, ensuring that the requested resource is accessed through the appropriate communication endpoint.
### What a query string is
A query string is a part of a URL that contains additional parameters or data appended to the end of the URL. It is used to provide specific instructions or information to a web server when making a request for a resource. The query string starts with a question mark ("?") and consists of key-value pairs separated by ampersands ("&").
The general format of a URL with a query string is as follows:
                                - http://example.com/path/to/resource?key1=value1&key2=value2
In this example, the query string starts with the question mark and includes two key-value pairs: "key1=value1" and "key2=value2".
Here are some key points about query strings:
- Parameters: Each key-value pair in the query string represents a parameter, where the key is the parameter name, and the value is its corresponding value. For example, in a URL like "http://example.com/search?query=books&page=2", the parameters are "query" with a value of "books" and "page" with a value of "2".
- Multiple Parameters: Multiple parameters can be included in the query string, separated by ampersands. For instance, "http://example.com/search?category=electronics&brand=apple" includes two parameters: "category" and "brand", each with their respective values.
- Encoding: Special characters, such as spaces or symbols, within the parameter values need to be properly encoded using percent encoding. For example, a space is encoded as "%20" in a URL.
- Data Submission: Query strings are often used in HTTP GET requests to submit data to a server. The parameter values can be used to filter search results, provide sorting preferences, specify page numbers, and more.
- Server-side Processing: The server receiving the request with a query string can extract the parameter values and use them to process the request. The server-side application or script can use the provided parameters to generate dynamic content, perform database queries, or execute specific actions based on the received data.
Query strings are commonly used in web applications for various purposes, such as search functionality, filtering, pagination, and customization of content. They enable the passing of additional information within the URL itself, allowing for flexible and dynamic interaction between clients and servers.
### What an HTTP request is
An HTTP request is a message sent by a client, typically a web browser, to a web server, requesting a specific action or resource. It is an essential part of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the protocol used for communication between clients and servers on the World Wide Web.
HTTP requests consist of several components and follow a specific structure. Here are the key elements of an HTTP request:
#### Request Line: 
The request line is the first line of an HTTP request and contains the HTTP method or verb, the target URL or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), and the HTTP version. The most common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, representing different actions to be performed by the server.
#### Request Headers: :
 Headers provide additional information about the request or the client. They include details such as the user agent (the client application or browser making the request), content type, accepted languages, authentication credentials, and more. Headers help the server understand the client's preferences and provide necessary information for processing the request.
 #### Request Body (optional):
 Some HTTP requests, such as POST or PUT, may include a request body that contains data to be submitted to the server. The body typically carries data for form submissions, file uploads, or API requests, among other purposes.
 #### Request Methods: 
 The HTTP methods or verbs define the intended action to be performed by the server upon receiving the request. The most commonly used methods are:
 - GET: Requests a resource from the server, typically used for retrieving data.
 - POST: Submits data to the server, often used for form submissions or creating new resources.
 - PUT: Updates an existing resource on the server.
 - DELETE: Removes a specified resource from the server.

 When a client sends an HTTP request to a server, it waits for the server to process the request and send back an HTTP response. The server analyzes the request, performs the necessary actions, and generates a response containing the requested resource or an appropriate status code indicating the outcome of the request.

 Overall, an HTTP request is a client-initiated message that communicates the client's intention to the server and prompts it to perform specific actions or provide requested resources. This request-response cycle forms the basis of communication on the World Wide Web.
 ### What an HTTP response status code is
 An HTTP response status code is a three-digit numeric code returned by a web server to indicate the outcome or status of an HTTP request. It provides information about whether the request was successful, encountered an error, or requires further action.

The status code is included in the response message sent by the server in response to the client's HTTP request. It helps the client (typically a web browser or an API client) understand the result of the request and take appropriate action based on the received code.

Here are some commonly encountered HTTP response status code categories and their meanings:
- Informational (1xx): These status codes indicate that the server has received the request and is continuing to process it. They are mostly used for intermediary purposes and are less commonly seen in regular web browsing.
- Success (2xx): These status codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and processed by the server. The most well-known success code is 200, which means the request was successful and the server is returning the requested resource. Other codes in this category include 201 for successful resource creation, 204 for successful request with no content, and more.
- Redirection (3xx): These status codes indicate that further action is needed to fulfill the request. They are used when a resource has been moved or temporarily redirected to a different location. Common codes in this category include 301 for permanent redirects, 302 for temporary redirects, and 304 for not modified (cached) resources.
- Client Error (4xx): These status codes indicate that there was an error on the client-side, and the server could not fulfill the request. They are often caused by incorrect or malformed requests. Examples include 400 for a bad request, 404 for a resource not found, 403 for access forbidden, and more.
- Server Error (5xx): These status codes indicate that there was an error on the server-side while processing the request. They typically indicate issues on the server that prevented it from fulfilling the request. Common codes in this category include 500 for internal server error, 503 for service unavailable, and more.

HTTP response status codes provide a standardized way for servers to communicate the result of a request to clients. By examining the status code, clients can determine whether the request was successful or encountered an error, and take appropriate actions based on the code received.
### What an HTTP Cookie is
An HTTP cookie, commonly known as a cookie, is a small piece of data that is sent by a web server to a web browser and stored on the user's device. Cookies are used to store information about the user's interaction with a website and enable various functionalities and personalization.
- Purpose: Cookies serve multiple purposes. They can be used to remember user preferences, track user activity, provide personalized experiences, implement shopping carts in e-commerce websites, and maintain user sessions (login status).
- Storage: Cookies are stored as text files on the user's device, typically in the browser's dedicated cookie storage. Each cookie is associated with a specific website or domain and is sent back to the server by the browser with each subsequent request to that domain.
- Structure: A cookie consists of a name-value pair and additional attributes. The name-value pair represents the data stored in the cookie, and the attributes provide information about the cookie's expiration, domain, path, and security requirements.
- Client-side Management: Cookies are managed by the web browser on the client-side. The browser includes the stored cookies in subsequent requests to the same website, allowing the server to retrieve and utilize the stored information.
- Stateless Protocol Enhancement: HTTP itself is a stateless protocol, meaning it does not inherently maintain any information about the user's previous interactions. Cookies enhance the stateless nature of HTTP by allowing servers to store and retrieve user-specific data.
- Privacy and Security: Cookies can raise privacy concerns as they can track user behavior and store personal information. To address these concerns, modern browsers provide options for users to control cookie acceptance and expiration. Additionally, secure cookies can be used to transmit data over encrypted connections (HTTPS).
- First-Party and Third-Party Cookies: First-party cookies are set by the website that the user is actively visiting. Third-party cookies are set by domains other than the one the user is currently browsing. Third-party cookies are often used for tracking and advertising purposes.
It's important to note that cookies have limitations and are subject to certain regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, which require explicit user consent for certain types of cookies.
Overall, HTTP cookies enable websites to store and retrieve information about user interactions, preferences, and sessions. They play a significant role in providing personalized experiences and facilitating various website functionalities.
### What happens when you type google.com in your browser (Application level)
When you type "google.com" in your browser and press Enter, several steps occur at the application level. Here's a high-level overview of the process:
- DNS Resolution:
The browser initiates a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup to resolve the domain name "google.com" to its corresponding IP address. It sends a DNS request to a DNS server, such as the one provided by your internet service provider (ISP).
- Establishing a TCP Connection:
    - Once the browser obtains the IP address of "google.com" from the DNS server, it establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the server that hosts the Google website.
    - The browser sends a TCP SYN packet to the server, initiating a three-way handshake process to establish a reliable connection.
- HTTP Request:
    - After the TCP connection is established, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server.
    - The request typically uses the GET method and includes the URL "http://www.google.com" and other headers such as the user agent, accepted language, and cookies (if any).
- Server Processing:
    - The server receives the HTTP request and processes it. In the case of "google.com," the server might identify the requested resource as the homepage or a search query.
- Generating a Response:
    - The server generates an HTTP response that includes the requested resource or performs the necessary actions based on the request.
    - For "google.com," the response could be an HTML page containing the Google homepage or search results.
- HTTP Response:
    - The server sends the HTTP response back to the browser over the established TCP connection.
    - The response includes a response status code (e.g., 200 for a successful request), headers (e.g., Content-Type), and the response body (e.g., HTML content).
- Rendering the Web Page:
    - The browser receives the HTTP response and starts processing it.
    - It interprets the HTML content, fetches additional resources like CSS and JavaScript files, and renders the web page accordingly.
    - The browser displays the rendered page to the user, showing the Google homepage or search results.
